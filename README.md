## Navigating Four Decades of Unemployment Trends in Australia to Predict and Forecast Future Unemployment Trends.

##### Dataset Overview

This project analyzes four decades of unemployment data in Australia (1982-2023) to predict future trends. The dataset, AUS data 2023.xlsx, contains quarterly unemployment rates alongside relevant economic factors, such as GDP changes, government expenditure, and job vacancies. The dataset is a comprehensive resource for exploring how these variables influence unemployment and for developing predictive models to forecast unemployment trends in Australia.

##### Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Australia's unemployment rate using various Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms (SMLAs) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The models developed include Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels. Extensive hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation were conducted, with the ANN ultimately achieving the best performance. The project highlights the application of advanced machine learning techniques for economic forecasting and decision-making in policy and business.
